    <h1>Introducing Operating System</h1>
    <h2>Thread in operating system</h2>
    <h3>What is thread?</h3>
    <p>A thread in an operating system is the smallest unit of execution within a process.
        It's a sequential flow of task. Threads are also termed as lightweight process as they share common
        resources.</p>
    <p>Example: While playing movie on a device the audio and video are controlled by different threads in background.
    </p>
    <h3> Why do we need thread?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Since thread use the same data and code, the operational cost is low in thread.</li>
        <li>Creating and terminating thread is faster compared to creating or terminating a process.</li>
        <li>Context switching is faster compared to processes.</li>
        <li>Thread improve CPU utilization, reducing idle time.</li>
        <li>Threads communicate easily via shared memory.</li>
    </ol>
